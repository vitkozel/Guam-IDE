## Getting started
Thank you for visiting Guam repository! Hope you will have a great time and that you'll survive my coding "skills" (and also my English (please I need to visit a therapist)).

All Guam's core code is in the `Guam/` folder.<br>
If you want to just download any of the old builds, you can do so by visiting the `ι Builds/` folder.<br>
The last folder is `ι Others/` that contains random stuff (not necessarily Guam-related tho).
